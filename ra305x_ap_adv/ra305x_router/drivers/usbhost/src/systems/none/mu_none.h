 * Non-OS implementation of UDSI
 * $Revision: #2 $
 */

/**
 * Introduction to non-OS UDSI implementation.
 * The non-OS UDSI implementation must delegate more to 
 * the target-specific code.
 * This is because each non-OS target can be vastly different.
 * For example, it is likely that each non-OS target has a unique
 * memory-mapped I/O mechanism, memory protection strategy (if any),
 * ISR installation mechanism, shared interrupt mechanism (if any),
 * required implementation of timers, and console I/O mechanism (if any).
 * Target-specific code needs to implement:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>MUSB_ReadConsole
 * <dd>Blocking read of a console character
 * <dt>MUSB_WriteConsole
 * <dd>Blocking write of a console character
 * <dt>MUSB_BoardMessageString
 * <dd>Only used if diagnostic messages enabled
 * <dt>MUSB_BoardMessageNumber
 * <dd>Only used if diagnostic messages enabled
 * <dt>MUSB_BoardGetTime
 * <dd>Only used if overhead statistics are enabled
 * <dt>MUSB_BoardInitController
 * <dd>Called by the non-OS implementation of MUSB_InitSystem
 * <dt>MUSB_BoardInitTimers
 * <dd>Called by the non-OS implementation of MUSB_InitSystem
 * <dt>MUSB_BoardDestroyController
 * <dd>Called by the non-OS implementation of MUSB_DestroySystem
 * <dt>MUSB_BoardRunBackground
 * <dd>Board-specific background processing
 * <dt>MUSB_BoardArmTimer
 * <dd>Arm a timer
 * <dt>MUSB_BoardCancelTimer
 * <dd>Cancel a timer
 * <dt>MUSB_BoardPrintDiag
 * <dd>Only used if diagnostic messages enabled
 * <dt>MUSB_BoardSystemToBusAddress
 * <dd>Translate CPU address to bus address (for programming a DMA controller)
 * </dl>
