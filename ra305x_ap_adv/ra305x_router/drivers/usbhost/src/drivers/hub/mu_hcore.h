/**
 * MUSB_Hub (Hub specific data structure). When Hub device is connected then  
 * Hub connect function is called. This function allocates as well as 
 * initializes few fields of this data structure. 
 * 
 * @field pUcdPrivateData : Data given by STACK/UCD. 
 *
 * @field busHandle : session "handle" used for different pipe operation.
 *
 * @field pUsbDev   : Pointer to USB device i.e. USB device representation of HUB.
 *
 * @field pInfDscr   : Interface for which HUB driver is selected. This information 
 *                     will be given by UCD and hub driver will store just reference 
 *                     pointer. There will not be any allocation. 
 *
 * @field pEndpDscr  : Interrupt endpoint for which IRP is going to submit. 
 *                     This pointer is pointing to location where Endpoint 
 *                     descriptor is stored by UCD. 
 *                     For this field there will not be any pointer allocation.
 *
 * @aHubRawDscr     : This will act as buffer for hub descriptor in raw format.
 *                    Later data will be taken from here and stored in proper
 *                    format of hub descriptor. 
 *
 * @field hubDscr   : HUB descriptor in proper format will be store here.
 *
 * @field ctrlIrp   : IRP used by Hub for all control transaction. 
 *
 * @field setupPacket : Setup packet as per USB 2.0 specification.
 *
 * @field aHubPortStatus : This field is used in control IRP as IN buffer to store
 *                         either hub or port status.
 *
 * @field hubStatus   : Status of the hub will be stored here. 
 *                    
 * @field portStatus  : Status of a port will be store here.
 *
 * @field intrInIrp : IntrIrp which gives information about Hub and Port status change.
 *
 * @field intrInPipe: Interrupt pipe handler.
 *          
 * @field aStatusBitMap : Contain status change information of all the ports as well as
 *                        hub. 
 *
 * @field pChild    : pointer of Connected USB devices at different ports of the HUB. 
 *                    Hub Class driver will update this information when enumeration is 
 *                    completed by UCD.
 * 
 * @field bState     : State of the HUB. 
 *
 * @field bNextState : Next state of hub if the given request executed properly.
 *                     When IRP is executed properly then first statement of any
 *                     callback would be bState = bNextState;
 *
 * @field aHubPortState : State of the active port i.e. port for which currently requests are 
 *                     sent or received. 
 *
 * @field bActivePortNum : Port number used for current request or presently all the request
 *                         will go to this port.
 * 
 * @field bSpeed : Speed of newly connected device to the hub's port.
 *
 * @field debounceParam  : Parameter used during debounce period.
 *
 * @field resetParam     : Parameter used during Reseting a port.
 *
 * @field bAlternateSelling Current alternate setting value
 *
 * @field bTtType This field represents the TT type.
 *        Lower Nible first Bit(0-Bit) inidcates the presently Configured TT type
 *        ( It can have MUSB_HUB_SINGLE_TT(0) or MUSB_HUB_MULTIPLE_TT(1) )
 *        Upper Nible first Bit(4-Bit) indicates the TT type
 *        ( It can have MUSB_HUB_SINGLE_TT or MUSB_HUB_MULTIPLE_TT )
 *        If it doesn't have TT, then its value is MUSB_HUB_INVALID_TT
 *
 * @field bSelfPower This tells the power status of a hub
 * It can have MUSB_HUB_SELF_AND_BUS_POWERED(2),
 * MUSB_HUB_SELF_POWERED(1) or MUSB_HUB_BUS_POWERED(0). 
 *
 * @field bLocalPower This indicates the present power status of the hub 
 * This values is MUSB_HUB_LOCAL_POWERED(1) if local power supply is good; 
 * MUSB_HUB_NO_LOCAL_POWERED(0) If local power supply is not good.                        
 * 
 * @field bAllocatedPower In terms of units (unit = 100mA), This field is 
 * valid only incase of bus powered hub, because bus powered hub 
 * has to take care about the number of devices connected to the hub.
