/** 
 * Introduction to Host Filesystem Interface.
 * The functions herein can be implemented by an OS to allow
 * the Mentor USB mass-storage driver to be hooked into the OS'
 * filesystem mechanisms, thus allowing the Mentor driver to be
 * used without additional effort.
 * The callbacks herein are implemented by the Mentor driver,
 * exposing the functionality needed by an OS to use the mass-storage device.
 * The above could also be applied to a custom, non-OS environment.
 * The driver is threadless (it reacts to callbacks from the BSR context
 * and the HFI implementation).  This eases its use in a non-OS environment,
 * and allows flexible and optimal HFI implementation for each OS.

 * Add a mass-storage device.

 * it is ready for use.
 * The HFI implementation uses the device information to determine if
 * it can support the device, assign a volume name, and mount it.
 * Error messages on failure are the HFI implementation's responsibility,

 * is not supported; the device driver can try a different block
 * size if the underlying device supports multiple sizes
