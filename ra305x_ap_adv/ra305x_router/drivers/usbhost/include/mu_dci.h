/**
 * DMA Controller Interface (DCI) Introduction.
 * The purpose of this interface is to allow the UCD to use any
 * DMA controller, since this is an option in the Inventra USB cores.
 * The assumptions are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A DMA controller will be tied to an Inventra USB core in the
 * way specified in the Inventra core product specification.
 * <li>A DMA controller's base address in the memory map correlates
 * somehow to the Inventra USB core it serves.
 * </ul>
 * The responsibilities of a DCI implementation include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Allocating/releasing buffers for use with DMA
 * (this is OS-specific, but may also be specific to a
 * DMA controller, intervening busses, and a target's capabilities,
 * so the UCD cannot make assumptions or provide services here)
 * <li>Handling the details of moving multiple USB packets 
 * in cooperation with the Inventra USB core.
 * <li>Knowing the correlation between channels and the
 * Inventra core's local endpoint resources and data direction,
 * and maintaining a list of allocated/available channels.
 * <li>Updating channel status on interrupts,
 * whether shared with the Inventra core or separate.
 * <li>If the DMA interrupt is shared with the Inventra core,
 * handling it when called, and reporting whether it was the
 * source of interrupt.
 * </ul>
