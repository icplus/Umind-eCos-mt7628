 * Therefore, the zero-based index of endpoint descriptor E

 * (including setting 0) for interface M.
 * The array of NumAlternates is computed by this function.
 * It is the index iEnd that should be passed to MUSB_FindDescriptor
 * to find the desired endpoint's descriptor.
 * In a similar fashion, the index of the descriptor for alternate
 * setting A for interface N (>0) is:
 <pre>
 iAlt = A + NumAlternates[0] + ... + NumAlternates[N-1]
 </pre>
 * so iAlt would be passed to MUSB_FindDescriptor to find the desired
 * alternate interface's descriptor.
