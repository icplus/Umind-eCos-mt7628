	* Update to openssl version 0.9.6b. Make the patented algorithms
	not compiled by default. If you want them you must explisity turn
	them on and arrange for a license yourself.

	* First port to eCos of the OpenSSL library and test programs.
	This is version 0.9.1c. The origional can be found at
	www.openssl.org, which also contains more documentation etc,
	All but one test works. testssl fails because it tries to open
	a file that does not exist. 
	
	See doc/Licence for licensing conditions. These seems compatible
	with the eCos licence ideas, but im no lawyer. There are also
	some issues with patents. see doc/README.PATENTS.
