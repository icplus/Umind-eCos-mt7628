	GENERAL PORTING INSTRUCTIONS:

		For the Twofish code to work properly on a given CPU and compiler, 
		the following types must be defined correctly:
			
			BYTE		 -- must be an 8-bit unsigned quantity
			DWORD		 -- must be a 32-bit unsigned quantity
			LittleEndian -- must be defined as
								1 for little-endian CPUs (e.g., x86)
								0 for big-endian CPUs (e.g., 68K)
			ALIGN32		 -- must be defined as
								1 if misaligned 32-bit accesses are not allowed
								0 if misaligned 32-bit accesses are allowed

		Typically, these definitions are selected by including a #ifdef 
		that is true only for the given platform and defining each of these 
		quanitities	appropriately.  See the examples below (x86 and 68K), as
		well as the "template" for _MY_AES_PLATFORM.  The definitions below 
		for BYTE and DWORD should work automatically for most platforms.

		In addition, to maximimize performance, it is recommended that 
		the following macros should	be modified to use instrinsic CPU opcodes, 
		if possible:
			a) ROL and ROR
			b) for big endian CPUs, BSWAP(x) and _b(x,N)

		Note that porting this Twofish code to a platform where a C "char" 
		is not 8 bits in size may be very difficult!
